# Code Bytes

Code Bytes is a web based code editor which allows for collabarative editing in real-time. When a new project is created, it is added to its own seperate room. This way, changes made to one project will have no affect on the other. To have others edit your code in realtime, simply share your project link with them. The vide below shows a demonstration of this projects features and as well as how to use it.
